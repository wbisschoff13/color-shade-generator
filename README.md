# color-shade-generator

Utilises HSP.py from https://www.hsluv.org/ to generate a color palette based on a hex value. Most palette generators place the user's color in the middle of the spectrum and generate 4 lighter and 4 darker colors. This one will generate brand new colors that should cover the whole spectrum from light to dark.

The script analyses the colors used by Tailwindcss (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) and attempts to deliver a similar result using the specified color.
